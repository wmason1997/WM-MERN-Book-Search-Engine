## Credits 
I had a session with tutor Jacob Carver session on 03/09/2024. They helped talk me through the typeDefs.js and resolvers.js. Jacob also instructed me that the eventual goal was to be able to delete the routes folder and the API.js file in utils folder. Thanks, Jacob!


XLA help for the mutations.js refactoring.
